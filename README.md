# Transformers-Tutorial
Transformers have taken the AI research and product community by storm. We have seen them advancing multiple fields in AI such as NLP, Computer Vision, Robotics. In this talk/tutorial, I will be giving some background in Conversational AI, NLP and Transformers based Large Scale Language Models such as BERT and GPT-3. I will walk the audience through hands-on examples and how they can leverage such techniques in their applications.
